I've been working with software for most of my life and have over 20 years of professional experience working with business-critical applications including Oracle database driven monoliths, mobile apps, containerised microservices and serverless applications hosted in AWS's cloud platform.

My current role is as a Software Engineering Lead in the realm of logistics and fulfilment for UK's largest integrated pureplay digital retailer.
